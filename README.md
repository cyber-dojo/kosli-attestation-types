# kosli-attestation-types

Simple repo to create custom attestation types, to use in all cyber-dojo
service git repositories when attesting compliance evidence to [Kosli](https://www.kosli.com/).

For example:
  [this attestation](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/differ/blob/ca7872a6e039124a59e950568bb107f340cb0e2a/.github/workflows/main.yml#L275)
  sent unit-test evidence, using the `test-metrics` custom type, from the cyber-dojo differ CI pipeline workflow,
  which resulted in [this event](https://app.kosli.com/cyber-dojo/flows/differ-ci/trails/ca7872a6e039124a59e950568bb107f340cb0e2a?attestation_id=1d9edecb-5beb-4ade-96de-ef1b9467)
  in the Kosli Trail tracking differ's compliance.
